# usersDB

This project contains basic back-end development and testing of the most primitive blogging platform. It is intended to be used as a cheatsheet and a reference to work with more complicated stuff.


For the set-up run the following in the terminal

mkdir users
cd users
npm init
npm install --save mongoose mocha express supertest body-parser nodemon


then in the *package.json* add "test": "nodemon --exec 'mocha -R min'" in the script entry.
